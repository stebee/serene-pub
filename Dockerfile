# Must match the runtime stage's libc (Debian/glibc, see below). npm resolves
# native packages against the *build* platform, and this stage's node_modules
# is copied wholesale into the runtime stage — so building on Alpine picks
# @img/sharp-linuxmusl-x64, which then can't load on glibc. sharp is a hard
# (statically imported) dependency of @huggingface/transformers, so that
# failure takes the whole local-embeddings engine down with it: the import
# probe in embedding/index.ts throws, and the app reports local embeddings as
# unsupported on every Docker deployment.
